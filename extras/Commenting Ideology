Commenting Ideology:
- Every idea has a list of comments associated with it
- Comments is an list within ideas trunk
	- Holds each comment that was made under a given idea
	- Comment should have:
		- User who wrote the comment
		- Timestamp of when it was written
		- ID to be used for future reference
		- The text of the actual comment
		- ID of post it is linked to
		- Whether it is linked to an idea or a project
- Comments should display in chronological order
	- That is, they should show up from highest to lowest key number

var comment = { userid, likes [should be 0 to start with], text, timestamp, idea ID

How to post new comment:
1) Comment list should already be added to comment trunk for idea upon idea creation
2) Retrieve comment list based on idea
3) Add current comment to end of list
